                        Please respect the silence of the yoga room before, during and after class. Some students arrive early to relax or meditate before or after class.
                        Please leave your shoes in the locker rooms or cubbies. We do not wear shoes in the practice rooms.
                        Please do not bring your cell phone into the practice rooms.
                        Please understand that you can lie down on your mat or take childâ€™s pose at anytime you are needing rest.  This is always ok and you can join back into the practice whenever you would like.

                        <p>Make sure that you are properly hydrated with water.  A suggestion is to drink several glasses in the hours before class.

                        Wear lightweight clothes.
                        Please arrive 20 minutes early for class as we begin promptly and lock the doors 5 minutes before class begins.
